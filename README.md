Heritability and stability of penmanship
=======================

Computer-graphical comparisons of handwriting (sampled longitudinally) could answer several interesting questions:

* To what extent is penmanship inherited?  And from whom?

* What is the normal evolution of penmanship over time?

* Could certain changes in penmanship trigger early diagnosis and treatment of disease? 

This seems like an attractive project.

* The trait is nicely quantifiable with the right image-processing algorithms. 

* Samples are plentiful, even spanning entire lives, and including ones where disease developed.

* It could have practical medical application. 

    * It has long been known that persons with Parkinson disease can develop microscopic handwriting ("micrographia").  Having an early screen for that disease (and other causes of parkinsonism) would be important if disease-modifying therapies become available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29644751). 
    * It might be used to follow the course and treatment of persons with some types of tremor.
    * Handwriting is a highly neuro-integrative task, hence it could perhaps be used an indicator of general neurological health... or even fatigue.

The chief difficulty would seem to be in identifying the mathematical characterization of samples, beyond simple characteristics like writing-size. A good place to start would be the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, whose routine work often requires matching handwriting samples.

Sadly, this may be the last generation where it's possible to study penmanship, now that handwriting is being replacing wholesale by keyboarding (and whatever comes after that).
