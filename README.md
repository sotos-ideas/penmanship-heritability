Heritability and stability of penmanship
=======================

Has anyone ever studied this?

It seems ripe for study, because it should be a nice, quantitative trait, measurable by image-processing algorithms.

Of course, the question is, why do it, beyond academic interest.  On the other hand, this may be the last generation where it's possible to study it at all, now that handwriting is being replacing wholesale by keyboarding (and whatever comes after that).

Longitudinal assessment of penmanship in a single person might be of interest, too.  Parkinsonism causes a change in handwriting (micrographia).  Perhaps this could be an early screen for that disease, which could become important if a disease-modifying therapy is discovered.

Since it is such a neuro-integrative task, I also wonder if it could be an indicator of general neurological health.
